//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ["Pulp Fiction", "Nice guys", "Superbad" ]
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let theOneNotWatched = movies[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let len = movies.length;
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let n = (movies.length - 1);

let lastVar = movies[n];
